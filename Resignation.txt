Sub: Resignation from the post of teacher.

Respected Sir,

I wish to confirm that I am resigning my post of teacher at Shalom Hills International School with effect from 24th March 2019. My last date of employment will thus be 23rd March 2019.

I would like to thank you and the rest of the teachers for the support that you have given me throughout the tenure and appreciate the opportunities that I have had for personal and professional development.

I would be much obliged if you consider processing my experience certificate and salary slips along with the security deposit refund. This would help me immensely in my future career prospects.

Best Regards,
Reena Yadav
